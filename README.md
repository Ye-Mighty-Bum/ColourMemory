This was actually the code I submitted for a code test for a front-end position at Accedo on 2016, 29 Feb.

A functional copy of the game can be found here:

Use the ARROW keys and the ENTER key to control the game cursor.
The objective of the game is to match cards of the same colour.

Upon completing the game, the score is recorded in a database table and an email will be sent to the player congratulating him/her.
